Anderson asked the man if he had a cigarette, but he kept walking until he suddenly stopped, turned around, pulled out a gun and shot two .32 caliber bullets into Anderson.  As Anderson collapsed to the ground, the man shot Terry White three times.  Both boys were seriously injured, but survived the attack.  Manuel Moore was charged with assault with a deadly weapon for shooting Anderson and White.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.

The ambush left one serviceman slightly injured by broken glass which lightly grazed him.  The vehicle, which had no government markings, had just left the Las Americas expressway at an exit about one mile from the University of Puerto Rico, where three to four men were hiding under an underpass.  One perpetrator jumped out and opened fire on the government vehicle with a rifle, leaving 11 bullet holes in the vehicle.  This was the second attack against US military personnel in Puerto Rico in four months but it is unclear whether this attack was linked to the December attack of a Navy Bus as that incident was claimed by three different Puerto Rican nationalist groups.",Military,Firearms,0,1
